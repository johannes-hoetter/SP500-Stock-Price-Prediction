# Stock-Price-Prediction
This Repository contains the application for the Capstone Project of
Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. The result (by now) is an application which 
is able to provide stock price predictions for many of the Companies which are included
in the [S&P 500 Index](https://eu.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp-500).

### 1. Project Motivation
In the last project, we (the upcoming Data Scientists ;) ) were allowed to follow
a topic we find interesting ourselves. As I'm interested in financial topics, I 
thought it would be interesting to develop a little prototype for a Stock Price Prediction.
The motivation was not to build a perfectly fine Stock Price Predictor which will make me 
rich in no time. The data I collected simply doesn't contain the complete complexity of
the whole finance market. However, for some stocks my model collection was able to predict
good prices! Therefore I'm going to continue developing on this project.  
The main motivation was to start a whole "app-development" project from scratch. I had to
think about how and where I get my data from, whether I need to do a lot of conversion or 
cleansing, what kind of structure my model needs to have, how I develop the app as a whole, ... 
(the list goes on).  
I definitely learned a ton during this project even though the result is far away from perfect!
As I said, I'm going to continue working on this application :)

### 2. Installation

##### 2.1 Requirements


##### 2.2 Package Dependencies

### 3. File Descriptions

### 4. Technologies used
The project itself doesn't consist of pure Python. I used several frameworks or libraries - 
the most important ones are the following:
- Pandas: Handling Data
- PyTorch: Development of Neural Networks for Price Prediction
- Django: Web Development
- Chart.js: Visualizations in the App itself
- several more (like NumPy, Matplotlib, SQLAlchemy, ...)

### 5. Acknowledgements
I'd like to mention the help I got from many Stackoverflow Posts which helped me in a lot of
situations. Every part of code which I took or which inspired me to code in a certain way is
commented in the section of the app where it's used.  
Additionally, I'd like to thank Quandl for providing the Data for the Models.
